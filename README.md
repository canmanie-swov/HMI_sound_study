#### Basic.wav

A single pulse with a fundamental frequency of 261.63Hz (e.g., ‘middle C’, or C4) and the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 9th harmonic partials. The partials have a volume (relative to the fundamental frequencies) of -1.9dB, -3.1dB, -4.4dB, -8.0dB, and -10.5dB, respectively. An amplitude envelope with a linear attack of 3ms (to avoid audible clicks) and an exponential decay of 300ms was applied to mimic the sound of a struck bell.

#### Simple*.wav

The same pulse of the basic sound set is heard twice. A pitch interval was introduced by using a fundamental frequency of 349.23Hz (e.g., F4) for the second pulse (reversed in the case of a downward change). The time between the end of the first pulse and the start of the second pulse (e.g., inter-pulse interval) depends on the time until a change in automation reliability. At 60s, 30s and 10s before the change, the inter-pulse interval decreased from 800ms to 300ms and 0ms, respectively.

#### Complex*.wav

The overall volume decreases with a longer time until a change in automation confidence (-3dB, -6dB, and -12dB for 10s, 30s, and 60s until a change, respectively). At 30s before a change in automation confidence, partials 6 and 9 were removed, and at 60s, partial 4 was attenuated by another 9.5dB. The attack time was increased to 100ms, as echoes typically feature smeared transients. The pulse with the lowest pitch (e.g., corresponding with a lower automation reliability level) was adapted to simulate the effect of a broken machine. At 10s before a change, the 3rd, 4th, and 6th partials were turned into inharmonic partials (e.g., base frequency multipliers of 2.9, 3.9, and 5.9, respectively). At 30s and 60s before a change, only the 3rd and 4th partials were affected.
